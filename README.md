# Data-Model-to-find-Quality-of-Wine
**Applying Machine Learning Algorithm Using R**

In this project we applied machine learning algorithm to determine the quality of wine. 

### Procedures : 

*  Imported dataset into R, checked data characteristics and missing values 
*  Performed Correlation
*  Defined Task, Experience and Performance Criteria
*  Changed values of class “Quality” from  nominal to binomial 
*  Applied Logistic Regression model for prediction
*  Performed 10 Fold Cross Validation 
*  Measured model performance through Confusion Matrix
